1. The purpose of this program is to model the research work by
   Morris (1981). In this program, the model (M) learns the location
   of a hidden platform (P), through a series of trials. In
   the beginning, the model explores the environment in search of the platform.
   However, on subsequent trials, the model begins to learn the location of
   the hidden platform, and the model begins to exploit its knowledge to find
   the platform.
2. Excluding this file, there is one other file in this program:
   WaterMazeTest.py.
3. In this program, the water maze and the q-values for the states in the
   water maze are both stored as 2-D lists.
4. This program uses Q-learning with a softmax to model mice performance
   on the Morris water maze test.
5. Users running this program must have matplotlib, NumPy, and pandas installed
   on their computers.
